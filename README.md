## 🧰 **Tech Stack**

| Tech | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🗄️ MongoDB | Database for storing users, bookings, and destinations |
| ⚙️ Express.js | Backend server and API routing |
| ⚛️ React.js | Frontend UI and interactive components |
| 🟢 Node.js | Backend runtime environment |
| 💻 JWT & bcrypt | Authentication and password hashing |

---

## ⚙️ **Features**

- ✅ **User Authentication** – Sign up, login, and secure access  
- ✅ **Explore Destinations** – Browse travel packages with images and details  
- ✅ **Booking Management** – Book trips, view, update, or cancel bookings  
- ✅ **Dashboard** – View past bookings and profile info  
- ✅ **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Users navigate pages: Home, Destinations, Dashboard, Booking  
   - Forms for signup/login and booking are validated before sending requests  

2. **Backend (Express + Node.js)**  
   - API routes handle CRUD operations: `/users`, `/destinations`, `/bookings`  
   - JWT authentication protects private routes  
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt  

3. **Database (MongoDB)**  
   - Stores user info, bookings, and destination data  
   - Connected via Mongoose for schema management  

4. **Interactions**  
   - User signs up → logs in → views destinations → books trips → dashboard shows bookings
